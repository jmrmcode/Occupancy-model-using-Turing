# Occupancy-model-using-Turing
MacKenzie et al's (2002) species occupancy model using Turing
## Purpose
Species occurrence (or "site occupancy") is an important variable when researching wildlife. Let'say *Z*<sub>i</sub> is a binary variable taking *Z*<sub>i</sub> = 1 when site *i* is occupied by a species and *Z*<sub>i</sub> = 0 otherwise. False absences, i.e., a species is not detected but present, are frequent when collecting field data. The detection probability *p* is defined as the probability of detecting a species when present.
